# CTFd-scrapper

!!! This script is just experimental. I nerver actually tried it, other than one ctf. So you're on your own!!!

This tool will just grab every challenges and save them on your local machine.

This will only work on CTFd framework. And it's still under development.

# why i made this?
I wanted to be productive while creating this script. But who knew that it would end in such a disappointment.
